**JobOffer Aggregator** is my side project where I aim to scrape as much data as possible from all available job portals in Poland. The goal is to generate comprehensive reports with insightful analyses of required skills, salaries, and other relevant trends in the job market.

For example, this tool can help determine which cloud platform is the most popular among Polish companies, or how frequently Go appears as a required skill for DevOps engineers.
